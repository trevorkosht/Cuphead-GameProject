Readability comments:
This file contains a lot of nested conditional logic and loops to deal with the vine attack in the boss level. Unfortunately this contributes to the file having readability issues, especially since many of the if statements are consecutive if blocks to work properly, rather than an if-else statement, making it a bit harder to track the flow of conditional logic. There are some small logical reconfigurations that could make this file more readable, as well as updating some of the variable names. The different logical blocks also aren't spaced out, which would also improve visual clarity and make it easier to tell them apart and trace control flow. Especially since so many of them are consecutive if blocks it makes it a bit harder to tell right away that they are not just a single if-elseif-else block.

WinMenu.cs

Code maintainability comments:
This file has a bit of awkwardly designed code simply by necessity: it needs to calculate a bunch of stats and then format them in a specific way for the win screen, so there has to be a lot of hard-coded values for the formatting to get everything lined up properly on screen, since the menu is made up of a lot of parts. That being said, some of the code that handles getting and calculating game stats and score could be extracted out into its own class. Right now the file is handling both formatting and drawing the menu as well as calculating statistics, and separating those into two classes would increase cohesion and improve readability, as well as making everything more maintainable. Since the file is trying to handle two fairly distinct tasks, it would make sense to separate them while still maintaining full functionality, since it would be very easy for the WinMenu class to just pull values from the stat handler class and then print them on screen.

Game1.cs Has become a bit of a mess and a hodgpodge of many different things. Most of which do not belong here. This has caused a pretty terrible maintainabity score. Looking at LoadContent(), is where we see a lot of stuff that should be handled in a different location. Like all of the player being loaded here. Player loading should happen in a player loader method that returns a functional player. Same with UI. The Update() function should remove a lot of the logic and use different controllers that already exist to handle it. With the removal into sepereate files Game1.cs would have lower cyclomatic complexity, and much higher maintainability.

I believe the quality of this file to be pretty good. The simplistic approach to drawing the card lowers the amount of code that needs to be written. However there are some aspect that it can imporve on. For example there is a ton of texture passed into the constuctor. It can be lowered by calling texture2d storage. It would also be easier to maintain if the numbers at on top and not hard coded into the methods. lastly many parts of the DrawScoreUI can be split up into more sub methods to improve readability and maintainability

Cyclomatic complexity: 55
Depth of inheritance: 1
Class coupling: 18

This file is designed fairly well overall, this file has to have a high cyclomatic complexity just from the task it handles. However there are some spots that could be improved and refactored slightly to improve complexity and readability. In UpdateFacingDirection an if-else statement can be replaced with one Boolean assignment. Additionally multiple if statements in HandleDucking can be simplified to single if statements. This file has high cyclomatic complexity as required by controlling all the player's movement commands, but small changes could be made to improve design of logic and control flow in some of the methods.

Review Time: 10 minutes
Comments: Large methods like Shoot, HideUnderCap, and EmergeFromCap could be broken down into smaller methods to separate out distinct responsibilities such as projectile behavior and creation, etc, which would make the code easier to read and extend. There are a lot of repeat calls to access the GOManager which could require a lot of refactoring when changes need to be made later. Using constants or enums in place of hardcoded values would further improve clarity and reduce the risk of errors due to changes in the game logic. Lastly, grouping related logic together  would make the class more intuitive and easier to maintain as the project evolves as now the method layout doesn't seem to follow the logic flow as well as it could.

File Name ProjectileFactory
File Author: Trevor Kosht
Review time: 20 minutes
The method has high cyclomatic complexity (22), indicating multiple branching paths and conditional logic, which could be refactored into separate methods or classes to simplify the main flow. Each projectile typeâ€™s initialization could be separated into individual helper methods or classes implementing a common interface, following the Factory Method or Strategy design patterns. Additionally, complex calculations for projectile positioning and offset adjustments could be extracted into methods for modularity, reducing the need for inline calculations and enhancing readability. The class coupling (23) is relatively high, with various dependencies on GOManager, BoxCollider, CircleCollider, and SpriteRenderer. By encapsulating animations, colliders, and textures within dedicated configuration classes, we can centralize and simplify component setup, further improving the maintainability index of the code and facilitating future changes to projectile types or behavior.

SPRINT REFLECTION:
This sprint was the last hoorah for the game, in which the team added an abundance of polish. There were many tweaks to animations, effects, enemies and projectiles to make the game play and feel much better. In addition UI and Sounds were a key addition which made the game feel alive. We were able to add some key features from the orginal into the game this sprint as well. Things like directional shooting, and parrying which were massive undertakings. The team focused on improving code quality for many files this sprint with more to come in Sprint 5.

When collision detection got added, it was not done so in a seperate file, this causes a lot of condition statememts which upped our Cyclomatic Complexity. To solve this we can remove many of the collision conditionals to another file. 
BothersomeBlueberry also has a decent amount of coupling, by removing the reached edge and other collision detection into a seperate file it will reduce coupling. 
With these simple fixes BothersomeBlueberry will have increased code quality.

Review Time: 10 minutes

I would say most of the code is readable with the update method a bit long and complex. This makes the code harder to maintain. The update method also has a bunch of statements so it could add some Cyclomatic Complexity. The coupling isn't too bad, since it is only used in the projectile factory. There aren't many lines of code since it only includes 1 type of projectile. Overall, other than the update method, the file is very well done, and the update method can improve by moving some blocks out and making them methods.

File Name: TerribleTulip.cs
File Author: Trevor Kosht, Ben Vidmar-McEwen
Review Time: 10 minutes

Several aspects make the quality of the TerribleTulip class questionable, particularly with respect to coupling and maintainability. The coupling is 18, meaning this class depends on or is closely connected with several outer systems: a player, projectiles, visual effects, and different renderers. In such a situation, this class will hardly be modifiable or reusable independently. Such strong dependence increases the risk of cascading changes at every modification of related classes. Also, the score of 65/100 for maintainability suggests that it works but is neither clear nor flexible. Poor separation of concerns is an issue: such as mixing shooting logic with animation management, and most of the code logics depend on hard values. This makes it inflexible and difficult to read. Refactoring might involve breaking down responsibilities into smaller, more modular components and reducing coupling for better maintainability.

Maintainability: 58
Cyclomatic complexity: 45
Depth of inheritance: 1
Coupling: 10

This file scored worse than average on maintainability and cyclomatic complexity, though the depth of inheritance and coupling scores are good. 

This file handles the logic for each action the player can take, like moving. The high cyclomatic complexity makes sense for this type of file since the player has many different states and animations it can be in, some of which are dependent on other states like the ducking while shooting animation. The cyclomatic complexity could be reduced by increasing the number of states that need to be handled, and making them all more specific. However this just shunts the cyclomatic complexity over to the PlayerState code, these conditional logic statements have to happen somewhere. 

The maintainability of this code is a little low due to the fact that it is designed to handle a set and predetermined number of states and actions that the player could take. It could be hard to edit or add on to the methods defined here, since it could be easy to cause a bug in the player behavior, since a lot of it is handled here.

Comments: There are lots of if/else statements, many of which are nested. This adds some complexity to reading the code because you have to follow long trails of conditionals to follow the logic of the class code. There are also many different methods inside the PlayerMovement class which makes it harder to locate specific code you are looking for. We could benefit from possibly breaking this class into smaller pieces to make the class length longer and the code more readable.

File Name: PlayerCollision.cs
File Author: Zol Chen
Review Time: 10 minutes
Comments: The PlayerCollision class could benefit from reworking to improve Maintainability. There is a separate function for colliding with all the different GameObjects which significantly increases the length of the class and suggests for any future collisions to be handled, another function would need to be created and added to the switch case. We could look to consolidate the collision functions into less overall functions by grouping similar logic.


SPRINT REFLECTION:
The team excelled this sprint. While the team handled some tough challenges the final product of the sprint is something we are all very proud of. Some key moments of the development of this cycle were, seeing the level come together for the first time, added in different types of colliders like a slope, fixing difficult enemy ai, and adding a ton of polish to the game that makes it feel alive. 
The team needed to adjust a bit this sprint. Features like directional shooting and a paralax background had to be pushed to a later date, but the team still has plans to add these features.
